      <p>
        Pediatric cancer is a large issue, and it requires its own research and
        effort, separate from adult cancers. In children ages 1 to 14, cancer is
        the 2nd leading cause of death after accidents. In 2021, an estimated
        1,190 children under 15 years old are expected to die from cancer, and
        an additional 10,500 will be diagnosed with it. While modern technology
        and medical innovations have improved the survival of pediatric cancer
        patients (which dropped 65% from 1970 to 2016), further research is
        still necessary, especially research directed towards childhood cancers.

        <h2>What makes it different from adult cancer?</h2>
        <p>
          Cancers that affect children are very different from those that affect
          adults. They are different types of cancers because of the different
          causes; many adult cancers are caused by lifestyle and environment.
          Consequently, their biologies are very different, making some
          treatments ineffective against childhood cancers. Also, children
          typically respond better to treatment because of the difference in the
          types of cancer, the higher intensity of the treatments, and the fact
          that children often don't have other health issues. Because of these
          differences, treatments for childhood cancers require their own
          research. With these developing treatments, side effects are a greater
          concern because children’s bodies are developing, and most current
          treatments cause long-term side effects.
        </p>

      <div class="mb-3">
        <h2>Causes</h2>
        <p>
          The causes of pediatric cancer are mostly unknown. Only about 5% of
          childhood cancers are genetic, or caused by inherited mutations.
          However, most cancers are not caused by inherited mutations, but by
          gene mutations early in the child’s life. It is difficult to identify
          the causes of these mutations for children, unlike for adults.
          Lifestyle causes, which apply for adults, don’t apply for children
          because they take many years to take effect. Also, with environmental
          causes, it is difficult to determine what carcinogens they were
          exposed to at such a young age. Some studies have reported various
          causes, although they are not strong enough to draw firm conclusions.
          Some examples of those causes are from parental exposure, like
          parent’s tobacco smoking, exposure at their workplace, or pesticides
          used around the home. Still, even with these findings, many cancers
          are caused by random events in the cell without any outside influence.

        <h2>Treatments</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Surgery</b> - During surgery, surgeons either remove or debulk a
            tumor. Debulking a tumor is when surgeons remove some of a tumor but
            not all of it in order to prevent damage to an organ or the body.
            Debulking a tumor improves the success of other treatments. Surgery
            can not be used to treat leukemia, which occurs in the blood, or
            metastasized cancer (cancer that spreads to other areas of the
            body).
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Chemotherapy</b> is a treatment that uses drugs to stop or slow
            cancer growth by killing rapidly growing cells. It is often used
            with other treatments, such as to shrink a tumor before surgery.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Radiation Therapy</b> uses high dose radiation to kill and shrink
            tumors. It does this by damaging the cells’ DNA, which causes them
            to stop dividing or die.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Immunotherapy</b> is a treatment that uses immune-system boosting
            drugs to fight cancer. The treatment can involve creating T-cells or
            antibodies designed to target specific cancer cells, administering
            vaccines, or inhibiting immune system checkpoints.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Stem cell transplants</b> are not treatments themselves, rather
            it is a way to recover from other treatments. This involves
            transplanting stem cells into bone marrow, taken from either the
            patient, a relative, or another person. It is often used with
            leukemia and lymphoma patients.
