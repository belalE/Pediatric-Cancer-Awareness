        <p>
          CRISPR Cas9 is a tool for gene editing, which was discovered through
          microbiological research. It changed our understanding of the genes
          that control the rapid growth and survival of cancer cells. In the
          future, it may help with cancer diagnosis, treatment, or prevention.

        <h3 id="histones">Histones</h3>
        <p>
          Histones are proteins that structurally support chromosomes and
          control gene activity. Research into these proteins and the impact of
          their gene modifications on the expression of genes has revealed its
          role on pediatric cancer. Specifically, in most cases of the pediatric
          brain tumor diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPG) , mutations in
          the genes for a specific histone protein prevented a modification,
          which makes it a driver mutation for the tumor.

        <p>
          Immunotherapy is a treatment that uses immune-system boosting drugs to
          fight cancer. Immunotherapy research has led to the development of new
          treatment methods in the past few years. One new treatment is chimeric
          antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy, which has helped pediatric
          leukemia and lymphoma patients in various clinical trials.

        <h3 id="cancer-rarity">Rarity of Childhood Cancer</h3>
        <p>
          Cancer is rare in children, who account for less than 1% of all new US
          cancer diagnoses each year. As a result, pediatric cancer patients are
          spread across many institutions, restricting the number of available
          patients at clinical trials. To overcome this, cancer research
          institutions and children’s hospitals need to collaborate in
          multi-institutional studies.

      </div>
      <div class="mb-4">
        <h3 id="unknown-causes">Unknown Causes</h3>
        <p>
          The causes of childhood cancers are unknown. While a small percentage
          is genetic and inherited from parents, most cancers are caused by
          random events in the cells. Also, unlike with adult cancers,
          environmental exposures are difficult to identify because it is
          difficult to pinpoint what the children were exposed to at that stage
          in their lives. So, research into preventative measures is difficult
          for childhood cancers.

          Differences between Adult and Childhood Cancers
        </h3>
        <p>
          Children and adults are generally affected by different types of
          cancers, and the biologies of the cancers are different. These
          differences prevent the use of treatments of adult cancers for
          children. For example, small genetic differences between the cancer
          cells make genetically-targeted treatments designed for adult cancers
          ineffective. Also, drugs that target specific pathways in adults may
          disrupt signaling pathways needed for development, making them
          difficult to use. So, childhood cancers need their own research, even
          independent of similar adult cancers.

          Considerations with Childhood Treatment
        </h3>
        <p>
          Because of children’s development, there are important considerations
          when creating treatments. One large issue is developing less toxic
          treatments. Because of intense cancer treatments, children who have or
          recovered from cancer have adverse side effects, which can last their
          entire lives. Future treatments need to consider this and attempt to
          decrease the incidence of acute and late side effects.
