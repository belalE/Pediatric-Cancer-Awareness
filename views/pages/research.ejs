  <h3 id="crispr">CRISPR Cas9</h3>
  <p>
    CRISPR Cas9 is a tool for gene editing, which was discovered through
    microbiological research. It changed our understanding of the genes that
    control the rapid growth and survival of cancer cells. In the future, it may
    help with cancer diagnosis, treatment, or prevention.

  <h3 id="histones">Histones</h3>
  <p>
    Histones are proteins that structurally support chromosomes and control gene
    activity. Research into these proteins and the impact of their gene
    modifications on the expression of genes has revealed its role on pediatric
    cancer. Specifically, in most cases of the pediatric brain tumor diffuse
    intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPG) , mutations in the genes for a specific
    histone protein prevented a modification, which makes it a driver mutation
    for the tumor.

  <h3 id="immunotherapy">Immunotherapies</h3>
  <p>
    Immunotherapy is a treatment that uses immune-system boosting drugs to fight
    cancer. Immunotherapy research has led to the development of new treatment
    methods in the past few years. One new treatment is chimeric antigen
    receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy, which has helped pediatric leukemia and
    lymphoma patients in various clinical trials.

  <h3 id="cancer-rarity">Rarity of Childhood Cancer</h3>
  <p>
    Cancer is rare in children, who account for less than 1% of all new US
    cancer diagnoses each year. As a result, pediatric cancer patients are
    spread across many institutions, restricting the number of available
    patients at clinical trials. To overcome this, cancer research institutions
    and children’s hospitals need to collaborate in multi-institutional studies.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="mb-4">
  <h3 id="unknown-causes">Unknown Causes</h3>
  <p>
    The causes of childhood cancers are unknown. While a small percentage is
    genetic and inherited from parents, most cancers are caused by random events
    in the cells. Also, unlike with adult cancers, environmental exposures are
    difficult to identify because it is difficult to pinpoint what the children
    were exposed to at that stage in their lives. So, research into preventative
    measures is difficult for childhood cancers.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="mb-4">
  <h3 id="differences">Differences between Adult and Childhood Cancers</h3>
  <p>
    Children and adults are generally affected by different types of cancers,
    and the biologies of the cancers are different. These differences prevent
    the use of treatments of adult cancers for children. For example, small
    genetic differences between the cancer cells make genetically-targeted
    treatments designed for adult cancers ineffective. Also, drugs that target
    specific pathways in adults may disrupt signaling pathways needed for
    development, making them difficult to use. So, childhood cancers need their
    own research, even independent of similar adult cancers.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="mb-4">
  <h3 id="treatment-considerations">Considerations with Childhood Treatment</h3>
  <p>
    Because of children’s development, there are important considerations when
    creating treatments. One large issue is developing less toxic treatments.
    Because of intense cancer treatments, children who have or recovered from
    cancer have adverse side effects, which can last their entire lives. Future
    treatments need to consider this and attempt to decrease the incidence of
    acute and late side effects.
